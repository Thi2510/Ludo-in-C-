# LUDO GAME IN C#

I created the Ludo game in the C# language with basic functions for moving pieces according to the dice roll.
Additionaly, i implemented features such as the game's rule system, respecting blocking and capturing rules bewteen players.
It is a simple project without a graphical interface but efficient in its final purpose.

To ensure an interactive experience, I added features like displaying the rolled dice,
indicating which player's turn it is, and the ability to choose different strategies for moving pieces.
I also included a scoring system to track each player's progress throughout the game.
