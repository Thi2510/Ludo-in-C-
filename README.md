# LUDO GAME IN C#
I created the Ludo game in the C# language with basic functions for moving pieces according to the dice roll.
Additionaly, i implemented features such as the game's rule system, respecting blocking and capturing rules bewteen players.
It is a simple project without a graphical interface but efficient in its final purpose.
